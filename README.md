# Hotel-Data-Analysis

The hotel data analysis project aims to uncover the reasons behind customer booking cancellations. It involves analyzing a dataset containing information such as booking dates, customer demographics, booking channels, and cancellation statuses. The analysis will focus on identifying patterns and trends that may influence cancellation decisions, such as lead time, booking source, and seasonality. By gaining insights into these factors, the project seeks to help hotels optimize their booking processes, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce cancellation rates.
